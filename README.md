# Disclaimer
This Power BI dashboard is similar to the one I created during my work in a bank. However, all data has been changed and replaced with the fictitious ones in order to not disclose confidential information.

The original dashboard is connected to the database via SQL queries. However, for the purpose of this demonstration the SQL queries have been omitted and only their results represented in Excel tables are being shown.
# Dashboard Location
Please folow [this link](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMDU3Y2YwNzItOTA0MC00M2Y0LThmM2UtNzFkN2Y1MTU0YjQyIiwidCI6IjUwYjA5MzA5LTEzMzgtNDRiZi1hODRkLTc1ZTcxYTgzOWFlNSIsImMiOjl9) to the Microsoft Power BI Report Server where the dashboard has been published and where you may fully interact with it.

When you first open the dashboard, it is recommended that you click on the Hints button <img src="https://github.com/oleksii-kosianchuk/fx-dashboard/blob/main/Hints.png" width="19" height="19"> to see the possible interaction options.
# Overview
The original Power BI dashboard is used by head of department, managers and heads of business centers to explore the activity of their clients with foreign exchange and its results. In a bank, the definition of client  refers to the legal entity or business group (multiple legal entities that are linked together through shared ownership, activity and management).
