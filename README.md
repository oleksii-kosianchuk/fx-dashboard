# Disclaimer
This Power BI dashboard is similar to the one I created during my work in a bank. However, all data has been changed and replaced with the fictitious ones in order to not disclose confidential information.

The original dashboard is connected to the database via SQL queries. However, for the purpose of this demonstration the SQL queries have been omitted and only their results represented in Excel tables are being shown.
# Dashboard Location

When you first open the dashboard, it is recommended that you click on the Hints button <img src="https://github.com/oleksii-kosianchuk/fx-dashboard/blob/main/Hints.png" width="19" height="19"> to see the possible interaction options.
# Overview
The original Power BI dashboard is used by Head of Corporate Banking Department, managers and heads of business centers to explore the activity of their clients with foreign exchange and its results (volumes and income generated for the bank).<br>
<i>In Corporate Banking, the term "client" refers to the legal entity or business group (multiple legal entities that are linked together through shared ownership, activity and management), and it is important to monitor both: proper risk and financial health assesment, to offer similar products with the same tariffs, Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Client requirements etc.</i>

Important definitions used:
- <b>foreign currency</b>: currency other than UAH;
- <b>client buys</b>: client exchanges its UAH for any foreign currency;
- <b>clients sells</b>: client exchanges its foreign currency for UAH;
- <b>client converts</b>: client exchanges its foreign currency for another foreign currency;
- <b>spot</b>: currency exchange that has taken place on the same day when client initiated the transaction;
- <b>forward</b>: currency exchange that happened at the agreed-upon date and exchange rate after client initiated the transaction;
- <b>card FX</b>: currency exchange that happens when client makes a transaction (ATM cash withdrawal, online/POS purchase) in a currency different from the currency of its card.
